# Solutions
>This repository has been created based on problem solutions from [codingame.com](https://www.codingame.com). I managed to find the problems using [codingame.tools](https://codingame.tools). The main idea is to categorize problems that I consider easy, medium, and difficult for all those people who want to learn programming by solving puzzles or those who simply want to improve their programming skills.
